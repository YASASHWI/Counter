# Counter Project

This is a simple counter application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application has two buttons: **Increment** and **Save**. The counter value increases each time the Increment button is pressed, and the current value can be saved by pressing the Save button.

## Features

- **Increment Button**: Increases the counter by 1 each time it's clicked.
- **Save Button**: Saves the current counter value and resets the counter to zero, allowing the count to continue.

## How to Use

1. Open the project in your browser by launching the `index.html` file.
2. Click the **Increment** button to increase the counter value.
3. Click the **Save** button to save the current counter value.
4. The saved values will be listed, and the counter will reset to zero, allowing you to start counting again.
